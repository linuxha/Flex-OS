# TSC's Flex OS source code for the 6800

This is just being setup so is currently mostly empty.

I find I have need of building a Flex OS for some of my boards. To do this I first need the source to the OS, then a way to assemble them, then a way to load them then a way to save them to some storage. 

I'll also need the source to the command use in Flex. Most of the commands are not part of the OS. They are commands external to the Flex & DOS source but use both to manipulate the data as needed.
